        <h3>Construction</h3>
        <p class="drill-description">Really the majority of my skills are derivative of my construction background. But what I found most interesting about the field is actually the portion where I was troubleshooting industrial control systems and creating drawings and diagrams to complete the understanding behind a specific problem. </p>

        <h3>Software</h3>
        <p class="program-description">Software was a piece of me that defined who I was. I can clearly remember a time when I was jailbreaking my first Iphone to be able to remote access my home PC in order to transfer files that I had forgetten to send myself when an important project was due that day. It was my saving grace. But also something that I had a very specific interest in. I'm very happy to have the opportunity to dive back into that and use it to solve problems that I have in my own entrepernuerial journey </p>
